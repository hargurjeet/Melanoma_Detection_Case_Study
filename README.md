## General Information
- Problem Statement -  To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- Porposed Soution - A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- Other information - The dataset contain images of 9 different types of meanoma skin cancer variants.

## Technologies Used
